# This workflow automatically applies labels to issues and pull requests
# based on regular expression matches against the content in the issue
# or pull request or file path pattern matches.
#
# The labels are declaratively defined in the following configuration files:
#   - File Path Patterns: .sync/workflows/config/label-issues/file-paths.yml
#   - Regular Expressions for Pull Requests: .sync/workflows/config/label-issues/regex-pull-requests.yml
#
# These will be mapped to the following directories in repos that use this reusable workflow:
#   - File Path Patterns: .github/workflows/label-issues/file-paths.yml
#   - Regular Expressions for Pull Requests: .github/workflows/label-issues/regex-pull-requests.yml
#
# Ideally, curl (or wget) could be used to grab the files from mu_devops in this workflow file and once on
# the local runner, the file path could simply be passed to the actions. That is not currently possible as
# the actions are hardcoded to use the GitHub REST API to get the files in the local repo. If that is fixed
# (tracked in https://github.com/github/issue-labeler/issues/39) then that approach can be used.
