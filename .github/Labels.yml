# Specifies the labels used in Project Mu repositories.
#
# This file is meant to define the labels used such that label management is consistent, centralized,
# and tracked in source control.
#
# Note that:
#   1. If a label color or description changes, the same label is updated with the new color or description.
#   2. If a label name changes, add the old label name to the `aliases` section. That will update the old label
#      to the new label keeping label usage in previously labeled issues and PRs.
#   3. All existing labels which are not listed in the manifest will be retained.
#      - We can specify to delete them in the future if desired.
#      - Please do not duplicate or let stale labels accumulate in repos. Only repo-specific labels should
#        be defined outside this file. Any other label should be reviewed and added to this file.

# Maintenance: Keep labels organized in ascending alphabetical order - easier to scan, identify duplicates, etc.
