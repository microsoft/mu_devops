# Specifies the labels used in Project Mu repositories.
#
# This file is meant to exactly define the labels used such that label management is consistent, centralized,
# and tracked in source control.
#
# Note that:
#   1. If a label color or description changes, the same label is updated with the new color or description.
#   2. If a label name changes, the previous label is deleted.
#   3. All existing labels which are not listed in the manifest will be deleted.
#      - All issues and PRs that were previously labeled with this label are now unlabeled.

# Maintenance: Keep labels organized in ascending alphabetical order - easier to scan, identify duplicates, etc.
