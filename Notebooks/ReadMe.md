# Project Mu VS Code Notebooks

These notebooks summarize Project Mu information across all of the Project Mu repos.

## How to Use

1. Install [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the `GitHub Issue Notebooks` VS Code extension
   - Extension ID: ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks
   - [Marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks)
3. Open a notebook file (e.g. `PullRequests.github-issues`)
4. Click `Run All` at the top of the  file to run all the queries

## How to View Dashboard in Web Browser

Since VS Code can run in your Web browser, you can treat this dashboard as a Web page rather than a file that you open
locally.

To view the file in the Web version of VS Code, simply open the file in GitHub and replace `github.com` with
`github.dev` in the URL.

- [Project Mu Pull Request Dashboard](https://github.dev/microsoft/mu_devops/blob/main/Notebooks/PullRequests.github-issues)
- [Project Mu Personal Issue & Pull Request Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_devops/blob/main/Notebooks/MyPullRequests.github-issues)
- [Project Mu Issue Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_devops/blob/main/Notebooks/OpenIssues.github-issues)

Once opened, run the same steps in [How to Use](#how-to-use) to install the extension and view the file. You can then
save the page to your bookmarks so you can easily load it in the future.
