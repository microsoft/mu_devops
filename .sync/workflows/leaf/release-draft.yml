# This workflow automatically drafts new project releases so it is obvious
# what a current release will look like at any time.
#
# It takes advantage of the labels used in Project Mu to automatically categorize
# the types of changes in a given release. In addition, the semantic version of
# the code is constantly maintained based on Project Mu label conventions to ensure
# semantic versioning is followed and a release version is always ready.
